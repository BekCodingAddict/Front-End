## What is Next.js

>[!TIP]
>Next.js is a popular React framework that enables developers to build fast, server-rendered, and statically-generated web applications with a variety of advanced features. Developed by Vercel, it extends React’s functionality by providing optimized tools for server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes, making it ideal for building production-ready applications.

### Key Features of Next.js
- Hybrid Rendering (SSR, SSG, and CSR):
  - Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Pages are rendered on the server at request time, which improves SEO and performance.
  - Static Site Generation (SSG): Pages are pre-rendered at build time and served as static HTML files, which makes them load faster.
  - Client-Side Rendering (CSR): You can also fetch and render data on the client side when needed, making it a flexible option for interactivity.
- Automatic Code Splitting:
  - Next.js automatically splits JavaScript bundles by page, meaning only the code required for the current page is loaded. This speeds up loading times and improves performance.
- Built-in Routing:
  - Next.js provides a file-based routing system. Simply add files to the pages directory to create routes (e.g., pages/about.js becomes the /about route).
- API Routes:
  - You can create backend API endpoints within the pages/api directory. This enables building full-stack applications without needing a separate backend server.
- CSS and Sass Support:
  - It has built-in support for CSS and Sass, as well as CSS Modules, making it easier to style your application.
- Image Optimization:
  - Next.js provides an Image component that optimizes images for faster loading, using techniques like lazy-loading and responsive images.
- Built-in Typescript Support:
  - Next.js has first-class support for TypeScript, making it easy to add type safety to your application.
- Dynamic Imports:
  - With Next.js, you can dynamically import components or libraries, reducing the initial bundle size and improving load times for large applications.

### How Next.js Works
- Pages and Routing: Files inside the pages directory automatically become routes. For example, pages/index.js is the home page, while pages/about.js is accessible at /about.
- Data Fetching:
  - getServerSideProps(): Fetches data on each request (SSR).
  - getStaticProps(): Fetches data at build time (SSG).
   - getStaticPaths(): For dynamic SSG routes, generates paths during build based on data.
- API Routes: You can create backend endpoints in pages/api (e.g., pages/api/user.js provides an API route at /api/user).

### Example Structure
- Here's an example of a basic Next.js application structure:
```css
my-app/
├── pages/
│   ├── index.js        // Homepage route
│   ├── about.js        // About page route
│   └── api/
│       └── hello.js    // API route at /api/hello
├── components/
│   └── Navbar.js       // Navbar component
└── public/             // Public assets (images, etc.)
```

### Why Use Next.js?
- SEO: It supports server-side rendering and static generation, which improves SEO.
- Performance: With features like code splitting, image optimization, and hybrid rendering, Next.js applications are typically faster.
- Full-Stack Capabilities: API routes allow you to build backend logic within your Next.js app.
- Developer Experience: It simplifies a lot of configurations (routing, data fetching, CSS, etc.), speeding up development.

Next.js is commonly used for e-commerce sites, blogs, dashboards, and any React app that needs great SEO and fast performance.

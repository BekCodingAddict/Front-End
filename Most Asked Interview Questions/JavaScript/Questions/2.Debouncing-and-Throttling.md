# What are Debouncing and Throttling?
>[!NOTE]
>Debouncing and Throttling are both performance optimization techniques used to control the rate at which a function is executed, especially when it is triggered by events like scrolling, resize, keypress, or input. They help improve performance by limiting the number of times a function is called during continuous event occurrences.

##  1. Debouncing
Debouncing ensures that a function is only executed after a specified delay following the last event trigger. In other words, it prevents the function from being called repeatedly during continuous events, and instead, it waits until the events stop for a set amount of time before executing.

### âœ… How it Works:
- When an event is triggered, it resets the timer.
- The function will only execute after the event stops firing for a specified period.

### Example: Debouncing Search Input
Imagine a search input field where every keystroke triggers an API call. Without debouncing, the function could be called on every keystroke, which would be inefficient.
```js
let debounceTimer;
const searchInput = document.getElementById("search");

searchInput.addEventListener("input", function () {
  clearTimeout(debounceTimer); // Clear the previous timer
  debounceTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Search triggered:", searchInput.value);
  }, 500); // Wait 500ms after the last keystroke
});
```

### Key Takeaway:
- Debouncing ensures the function only runs after a series of events have stopped for a given time.
- It is commonly used in search inputs, auto-suggestions, etc.


## 2. Throttling
>[!NOTE]
>Throttling limits the number of times a function can be executed within a certain period. It ensures that the function is called at regular intervals (e.g., once every 100ms) no matter how many times the event is triggered.

### âœ… How it Works:
The function can only execute once every specified interval, even if the event keeps firing within that interval.


### Example: Throttling Scroll Event
Imagine tracking the scroll position. Without throttling, the function could be triggered hundreds of times while scrolling.

```js
let lastExecutionTime = 0;
const throttleInterval = 200; // Execute function at most every 200ms

window.addEventListener("scroll", function () {
  const now = new Date().getTime();
  if (now - lastExecutionTime >= throttleInterval) {
    console.log("Scroll event triggered!");
    lastExecutionTime = now;
  }
});

```
### Key Takeaway:
- Throttling ensures the function runs at regular intervals during continuous events.
- It is commonly used for performance-heavy operations like scroll events, resizing windows, etc.

### ðŸš€ In Summary:
- Debouncing is useful when you want to delay the function execution until the user stops triggering the event (e.g., typing in a search box).
- Throttling is useful when you want to limit the rate of function execution to a fixed interval (e.g., tracking scroll position).

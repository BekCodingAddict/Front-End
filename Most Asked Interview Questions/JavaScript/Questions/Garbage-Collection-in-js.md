# How does garbage collection work in JavaScript?
Garbage collection (GC) is the process of automatically managing memory in JavaScript by reclaiming memory that is no longer in use. This prevents memory leaks and ensures efficient memory usage. Here's an overview of how garbage collection works in JavaScript:

## 1. Memory Management in JavaScript
JavaScript is a high-level language with automatic memory management. Developers do not need to manually allocate or deallocate memory. Instead, the JavaScript engine (e.g., V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox) handles memory management through garbage collection.

## 2. How Garbage Collection Works
Garbage collection in JavaScript relies on the concept of reachability. An object is considered reachable if it is accessible directly or indirectly from the root of the program (e.g., global variables, currently executing functions, etc.). If an object is unreachable, it is considered garbage and can be safely removed.

### Key Concepts:
1. Roots:
- Global variables.
- Currently executing functions and their local variables.
- References in the call stack.

2. Reachability:
- An object is reachable if it is directly or indirectly referenced from a root.

3. Unreachable Objects:
- Objects that are no longer accessible from any root are considered garbage.


## Best Practices:
- Avoid creating unnecessary global variables.
- Clear timers and intervals when they are no longer needed.
- Remove event listeners when they are no longer required.
- Use weak references (WeakMap or WeakSet) for objects that should not prevent garbage collection.

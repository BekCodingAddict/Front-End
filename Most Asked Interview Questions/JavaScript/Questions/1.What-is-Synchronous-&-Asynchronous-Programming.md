## What is Synchronous and Asynchronous programming in Javascript?

### Synchronous Programming
>[!TIP]
>Synchronous programming means tasks are executed sequentially, one after another. Each task must complete before the next one starts. If a task takes time (e.g., reading a file or performing a complex calculation), the program waits (blocks) until it finishes.

- Key Characteristics:
  - Blocking: Tasks block the execution of subsequent tasks until they complete.
  - Single-threaded: JavaScript executes code in a single thread, meaning it can handle only one task at a time in synchronous programming.
Example:
```javascript
console.log("Start");
console.log("Processing..."); 
console.log("End");
```
Output:
```sql
Start
Processing...
End
```
Each console.log runs in sequence, blocking the next line until it finishes.

### Asynchronous Programming
>[!TIP]
>Asynchronous programming allows tasks to be executed independently of the main program flow. Instead of waiting, asynchronous tasks are handled in the background, and the program continues executing the next line of code.

- ðŸ”‘ Key Characteristics:
  - Non-blocking: Tasks that take time (e.g., fetching data, reading files) do not stop the program's execution.
  - Concurrency: JavaScript can handle multiple tasks simultaneously using the event loop.
 Example:
```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Processing...");
}, 2000); // Simulates a 2-second delay

console.log("End");
```
Output:
```sql
Start
End
Processing...
```
- The setTimeout is an asynchronous function that schedules the task to run after 2 seconds.
- The program continues without waiting for the timeout to finish.

### How Asynchronous Programming Works in JavaScript
JavaScript uses the event loop and callback queue to handle asynchronous tasks:
- 1.Call Stack: Where JavaScript executes code.
- 2.Web APIs: Handles asynchronous operations like setTimeout or fetch.
- 3.Callback Queue: Stores callbacks for asynchronous tasks.
- 4.Event Loop: Continuously checks if the call stack is empty and then processes tasks from the callback queue.

### Common Asynchronous Patterns
1.Callbacks:
```javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        callback("Data loaded");
    }, 1000);
}

fetchData((message) => {
    console.log(message);
});
```
2.Promises:
```javascript
const fetchData = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve("Data loaded");
    }, 1000);
});

fetchData.then((message) => {
    console.log(message);
});
```
3.Async/Await:
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
    const data = await new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve("Data loaded"), 1000);
    });
    console.log(data);
}

fetchData();
```

### Key Differences Between Synchronous and Asynchronous Programming
| Feature |	Synchronous  |	Asynchronous |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Execution |	Sequential (one task at a time)	| Non-sequential (can run tasks in the background) |
| Blocking	| Yes	 | No |
| Use Cases | 	Simple tasks, calculations	| Network requests, file I/O, timers |

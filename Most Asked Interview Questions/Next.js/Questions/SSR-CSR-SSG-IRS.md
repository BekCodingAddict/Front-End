## Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the terms you mentioned:
### SSR (Server-Side Rendering):
- In SSR, the content of a web page is generated on the server and sent to the client (browser) as a fully rendered page. This means when a user requests a page, the server processes the data and renders HTML before sending it to the browser.
- This approach improves SEO and initial load time, as the page is fully rendered when it reaches the browser.

### CSR (Client-Side Rendering):
- In CSR, the web page is loaded as a blank HTML shell, and then JavaScript is responsible for rendering the content on the client-side (browser). The browser fetches data and renders the content dynamically.
- This approach is often faster after the initial load and offers a more dynamic and interactive user experience but can be less SEO-friendly because search engines may not be able to index content rendered by JavaScript.

### SSG (Static Site Generation):
- SSG is a method where HTML pages are pre-generated during build time rather than runtime. The pages are generated once when the site is built, and they are served as static files.
- This is great for performance because the pages are ready to be served directly to users without needing to render on the server or client every time. It also improves SEO since the pages are fully rendered.

### IRS (Incremental Static Regeneration):
- IRS is a feature in Next.js (a popular React framework) that allows static pages to be re-generated incrementally after the build. This enables you to update parts of your static site without rebuilding the entire site.
- The key advantage is that you can maintain the performance benefits of static generation but also keep your content up to date without redeploying the entire site.

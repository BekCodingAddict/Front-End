### What is the difference between inline, inline-block, and block elements?

>[!TIP]
>The difference between inline, inline-block, and block elements in CSS primarily lies in how they behave with respect to layout, positioning, and interaction with other elements. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

### 1. Block Elements
- Behavior: A block element takes up the entire width of its container by default, forcing any content that follows it to start on a new line. Block elements are stacked vertically, meaning they are displayed as a block and do not sit next to other elements unless explicitly positioned.
- Examples: div, p, h1, ul, section, article.
- Properties:
  - Takes up the full width of its container by default (unless a width is set).
  - You can set height, width, padding, margins, and borders.
  - They force a line break before and after them.
 
```css
div {
  display: block;
}
```
Example
```html
<div>This is a block element</div>
<div>This is another block element</div>
```
Both div elements will be stacked vertically, each taking up the full width of the container.

### 2. Inline Elements
- Behavior: An inline element only takes up as much width as its content and does not cause a line break before or after it. Inline elements are typically used for smaller elements within a block container, like text or links.
- Examples: span,a, strong, em, img.
- Properties:
  - Width and height cannot be set directly (they will be determined by the content).
  - You cannot set top, bottom, left, or right positioning.
  - They do not break the flow of text, meaning other inline elements can sit next to each other on the same line.
```css
span {
  display: inline;
}
```
example
```html
<span>This is an inline element</span>
<span>This is another inline element</span>
```
### 3. Inline-Block Elements
- Behavior: An inline-block element behaves like an inline element in that it stays within the flow of the document without forcing a line break, but it also behaves like a block element in that you can apply width, height, and margins.
- Examples: button, input, img.
- Properties:
  - Like a block element, you can set height, width, padding, and margins.
  - Like an inline element, it does not cause a line break and can sit next to other inline-block elements.
  - It does not force a line break after it, and multiple inline-block elements can sit next to each other horizontally.

```css
.inline-block {
  display: inline-block;
}
```
example
```html
<div class="inline-block">This is an inline-block element</div>
<div class="inline-block">This is another inline-block element</div>
```
Both div elements will appear next to each other, but you can control their width and height.

### When to Use Each:
 - Block elements are used for large structural elements like containers, sections, and paragraphs.
 - Inline elements are best for smaller pieces of content within a block, such as links, text, and images.
 - Inline-block elements are used when you need the behavior of inline elements (staying on the same line) but also want to control the width and height, such as with buttons or image galleries.

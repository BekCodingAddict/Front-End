## React Hooks Rules

### 1. Only Call Hooks at the Top Level
- What it means: Do not call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
- Why: React relies on the order of Hooks to manage state and effects. If their order changes, React can’t track them correctly.

Example (Incorrect):
```javascript
if (isLoggedIn) {
    useEffect(() => {
        // Effect logic
    }, []);
}
```
Correct:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    if (isLoggedIn) {
        // Effect logic
    }
}, [isLoggedIn]);
```
### 2. Only Call Hooks from React Functions
- What it means: Hooks must be called from functional components or custom Hook functions.
- Why: React Hooks are not designed to work outside of these contexts.

Example (Incorrect):
```javascript
function nonReactFunction() {
    useState('state');
}
```
Correct:
```javascript
function MyComponent() {
    const [state, setState] = useState('state');
}
```
### 3. Follow the Hook Naming Convention
- What it means: Custom Hooks should start with the prefix use.
- Why: This ensures React treats it as a Hook, enabling optimizations like the Rules of Hooks ESLint plugin.

Example:
```javacript
function useCustomHook() {
    // Custom hook logic
}
```
### 4. Don’t Call Hooks from Regular JavaScript Functions
- Hooks should not be called from event handlers, utility functions, or class components.
- Always call them directly in a functional component or custom Hook.

### Additional Tips
- Use the Rules of Hooks ESLint plugin to automatically detect violations.
- Keep your dependencies array for useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback accurate to avoid bugs.

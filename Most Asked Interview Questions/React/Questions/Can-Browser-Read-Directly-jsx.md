## Can web browser read directly jsx file?

No, a web browser cannot directly read and execute JSX (.jsx) files because browsers do not natively understand JSX. JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension used with React that needs to be compiled into regular JavaScript before it can run in the browser.

### Why Can't Browsers Read JSX?

- Browsers only understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.=
- JSX is not valid JavaScript; it must be transformed into regular JavaScript using a tool like Babel.

### How to Make JSX Work in a Browser?

To use JSX in a browser, you need to compile it into JavaScript using tools like:

1. Babel (Recommended)
2. Webpack + Babel
3. React Scripts (Create React App)

### Example: Using Babel in the Browser

If you want to write JSX inside an HTML file without setting up a full React project, you can use Babel CDN to transform JSX on the fly:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>JSX in Browser</title>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>

    <script type="text/babel">
      function App() {
        return <h1>Hello, JSX in Browser!</h1>;
      }

      ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<App />);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Alternative: Precompile JSX

For production, it's better to precompile JSX using Babel CLI or Webpack rather than relying on the browser to do it dynamically.

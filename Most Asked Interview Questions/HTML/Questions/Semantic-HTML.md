## What is semantic HTML? Can you give examples of semantic elements?

>[!TIP]
>Semantic HTML refers to HTML elements that convey meaning and structure about the content they contain, beyond just their appearance. These elements provide clear information to both developers and browsers about the role and purpose of the content, improving readability, accessibility, and SEO.

For example:
- A header tag indicates the top section of a page, often containing the title or navigation links.
-  A section tag defines a thematic grouping of content.

### Why Use Semantic HTML?
- Improved Accessibility: Assistive technologies, like screen readers, can better interpret the page structure.
- Better SEO: Search engines can more effectively index and rank your content.
- Easier Maintenance: Developers can understand the code structure at a glance.
- Consistent Styling: Semantic elements naturally group content, making it easier to app

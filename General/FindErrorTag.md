## How to find error tag inside big project in vs code

To locate the <tag> tag, you can try these approaches:

Search in Files:
- Open the file explorer in your code editor, usually on the left panel.
- Use the "Find in Files" feature (often triggered by pressing Ctrl+Shift+F or Cmd+Shift+F).
- Search for <sman> to locate any occurrences in your project.
- 
Inspect Component Code:
- Since the warning specifies <sman>, check any components or custom tags that might have been mistyped as <sman>. It could be a small typo in naming.

Disable Custom Props Temporarily:
- If you use props that are intended to be custom (like fetchPriority), you can comment them out temporarily to see if the <sman> tag is easier to identify.
